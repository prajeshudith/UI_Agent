This folder contains Cucumber feature files and Playwright step skeletons for automating the ParaBank demo application (https://parabank.parasoft.com).

Quick start (Node.js + Playwright):

- Ensure Node.js is installed.
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Run tests: npx cucumber-js

Files:
- features/: Cucumber feature files with scenarios.
- steps/: Playwright step definitions (skeletons).

Notes:
- The step implementations are intentionally minimal skeletons. You can expand them to include full Playwright interactions and assertions.
