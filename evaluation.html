    <h1>Test Automation Evaluation Report</h1>
    
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> PROCESS INVALID ‚ùå</p>
    <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> The test automation process partially met the requirements. While error handling and navigation to the registration page were successful, the login with valid credentials failed due to a server error.</p>
    <p><strong>Critical Issues Count:</strong> 1</p>
    
    <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Requirement Coverage Analysis</h3>
    <p>The user story required testing of login with valid and invalid credentials, and navigation to the registration page. All scenarios were covered, but the valid login scenario failed.</p>
    
    <h3>Test Execution Analysis</h3>
    <p>The sequence of actions was correct, with appropriate navigation and input actions. However, the server error during valid login indicates a potential issue with the application rather than the test script.</p>
    
    <h3>Output Quality Assessment</h3>
    <p>The test result files were complete and accurately reflected the test outcomes. The failure in the valid login scenario was clearly documented.</p>
    
    <h3>Issues and Problems Found</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="error">Server error during login with valid credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Findings Categories</h2>
    <h3>‚úÖ What was done correctly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Test scenarios were comprehensive and covered all acceptance criteria.</li>
        <li>Error handling for invalid and empty credentials was effective.</li>
        <li>Navigation to the registration page was successful.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>‚ùå What was done incorrectly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Valid login scenario failed due to a server error, indicating a potential issue with the application.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è What was missing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Additional logging to capture server-side errors could provide more insights.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>üí° Recommendations for improvement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Investigate server-side issues causing valid login failures.</li>
        <li>Enhance logging to capture detailed error information for troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> PROCESS INVALID ‚ùå</p>
    <p><strong>Justification:</strong> The failure of the valid login scenario due to a server error is a critical issue that needs resolution. While other scenarios passed, the inability to log in with valid credentials undermines the overall process validity.</p>
    <p><strong>Overall Quality Score:</strong> 70%</p>
    <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Address server-side issues and enhance error logging for better diagnostics.</p>
